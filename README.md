# About me
Collaborative, responsible, detail-oriented, and growth mindset are the top four adjectives that best define my aptitude towards work.

I work diligently as an individual and as a team member. I develop professional desktop, web, and mobile applications. My tasks concern analyzing, testing, debugging, troubleshooting, and implementing based on user or system design specifications.
